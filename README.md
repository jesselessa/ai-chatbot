## Demo

You can see a live demo of the project [here](https://www.ai-chatbot.jesselessa.dev/).

## Stack

### Frontend

- The user interface was created with **React** using **Vite** tool for rapid development.

- Client-side data requests, intelligent caching, and loading/error state management were handled using **TanStack Query**.

- The application navigation was managed by **React Router**.

### Backend

- The API was built with **Node.js** and **Express**.

- The database was created with **MongoDB**.

- AI response generated from text-only input or text-and-image input, using **Google Gemini API** [(https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs)](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs).

## Create a MongoDB database

Before running the project locally, you will need to set up your MongoDB database, following these steps :

### 1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account

MongoDB Atlas provides an easy way to host and manage your data in the cloud [(https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/)](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

### 2. Use one of MongoDB Atlas methods

There are three methods provided by MongoDB Atlas to create a database : using the UI (User Interface), the Shell (mongosh), or using Compass, the MongoDB GUI.

## Run the project locally

After setting up your database, you can run the project locally by following these steps :

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the location where you want the local repository to be copied.
2.  Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/jesselessa/ai-chatbot.git`.
3.  Navigate to the project directory : `cd ai-chatbot`. The latter is composed of two folders : `client` and `backend`.
4.  Copy the `.env.example` files from both the `client` and `backend` folders, and rename them to `.env` in their respective folders.
5.  Fill in the required values for the environment variables in each `.env` file.
6.  Install the dependencies necessary to the project inside each folder by running `npm install`.
7.  Then :
    - Inside the `client` folder, run the application in development mode : `npm run dev`.
    - Inside the `backend` folder, start the server and launch the database : `npm start`.
8.  Finally, open http://localhost:5173 in your web browser to view the live application.

**Important: Do not commit your `.env` files containing sensitive information (API keys, secrets) to a public repository. Add them to your `.gitignore` file**

## Getting Started with Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast development tool for modern web applications. To get started with Vite, follow these simple steps :

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en).

### 2. Initialize the project

If you have not already created a project, you can initialize a new project using the following command in your terminal : `npm init vite@latest my-project --template react`.

This command will create a new directory named `my-project` and install a Vite project with a React template in it.

### 3. Install dependencies

Once the project is initialized, navigate to the newly created directory (`cd my-project`) and install the dependencies by running the command `npm install`.

### 4. Start the development server

To start the development server, use the command `npm run dev`.

This will launch Vite and automatically open your default browser to http://localhost:5173, where you can see your live application.

### 5. Deploy to production

To build an optimized version of your application ready for production, use the command `npm run build`.

This will generate a production-ready version of your application in the `dist` directory of your project.
